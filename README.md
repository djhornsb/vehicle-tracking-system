# vehicle-tracking-system
A simple vehicle tracking system for the management of a small fleet.

This is my first official git project.

I was inspired to develop this project after witnessing the use of a rather primitive vehicle service tracking system at a friend's place of work.
As this is my first project, the system will be quite primitive (no GUI, txt/shelve files for saving information, etc.).
It's a work in progress at the moment, so this is going to be the extent of the README.
